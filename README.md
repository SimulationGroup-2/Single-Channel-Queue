<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The implementation of python projects deals with one problem of single-channel queuing problems. It shows that a single-channel queuing model without losses can be used to solve queuing problems. It is composed of the queue and service center and uses the FIFO system.A single-channel queue can be used for a bank system /ticket counter service/any delivery service.

### Requirements
The main requirements are listed below:
* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

<!-- Introduction -->
## Introduction
To describe queuing problems through mathematical formulation, some assumptions are made by considering arrivals and services as patterned by known function. Equations representing the distribution of the time between arrivals are used with other equations depicting other features such as the distribution of the service time. The relationship existing between these equations is the matter studied in waiting line theory. Arrivals of people or entry requirements (events) are customarily Poisson distributed. The duration of the service provided by people is usually exponentially distributed. For generating interarrival and service times, gamma and Weibull distributions are also utilized depending on the model as the exponential distribution is said to be a special case of
both of the gamma and Weibull distributions.







##**Single Channel Queue**##
So first we import scipy.stats package for importing necessary funtion.
Here we use Poisson and Exponential Distribution to generate interarrival time and service time respectively.
Âµ=5.6 customers/minute (arrival rate) Î»=1 customers/minute (service rate) for 20 customers.

In Poisson Distribution,Poisson distribution is described in terms of the rate (Î¼) at which the events happen. 
An event can occur 0, 1, 2, â€¦ times in an interval. 
The average number of events in an interval is designated Î» (lambda). Lambda is the event rate, also called the rate parameter.


In Exponential Distribution, we can generate an exponentially distributed random variable using scipy.stats module's expon.rvs() method which takes shape parameter scale as its argument which is nothing but 1/lambda in the equation. 
To shift distribution use the loc argument, size decides the number of random variates in the distribution.


So for Poisson Distribution we use mu=5.6 and size=19 .Because for the first customer interarrival time is always none(0) thats why we use size=19.
So for Exponential Distribution we use scale=1,loc=0,size=20.
Then we find the arrival time using the formula :current customer interarrival time + previous customer arrival time and implement it in a for loop.
Then we find out service time using Exponential Distribution using the above values.
For Time service begin time we use the formula : if (current customer arrival time < previous customer Time service Ends time ) then current customer Time service Begin time = previous customer Time service Ends time ELSE current customer arrival time.
For time service ends time we use we use the formula : current customer time service begin time + current custome service time.
For waiting time, using formula: if (current customer arrival time < previous customer time service ends time ) then Previous customer time service ends time - current customer arrival time ELSE "Zero".
Then finding the customer who wait by counting value of waiting time which is greater than "Zero".And implemented the logic in for loop.
For Time Customer Spends in System(min) = waiting time + service time and implemented the logic in for loop.
For idle time , we use formula: if (previous customer time service ends time < current customer arrival time ) then current customer arrival time - previous customer time service ends time ELSE "Zero".
Finally generating the whole single channel queue  table.
And also find out the Average number of customer waiting and Average waiting time for a customer.
